"""Shared helpers for unit tests in tests/unit/probabilistic/flow/.

Consolidates duplicate copies of ``_train_small_2d_flow`` that previously
lived inline in several test modules (test_certify_halfspace_disjoint,
test_certify_adaptive_n, test_scenario_sampling_qmc, test_amls). All
copies trained the same toy flow on N(0, I_2) with sinkhorn coupling,
EMA, and uniform time sampling; the only divergence was ``n_epochs``
(100 vs 200), so we adopt the 200-epoch canonical version used by the
majority of call sites.
