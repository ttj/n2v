"""Soundness check for the ``_GenericONNXWrapper`` batched-inference fix.

Some VNN-COMP ONNX exports (notably ``metaroom_2023``) embed a literal
``Reshape`` op whose target shape is ``(1, -1)``, which collapses the
batch dim. Before the fix, the wrapper detected this and fell back to a
per-sample loop, making the wrapper an O(N) bottleneck on every flow
training / scenario forward.

The fix patches the offending ``OnnxConstant`` from ``(1, -1)`` to
``(-1, K)`` (where K is the per-sample flat size measured during a
batch=1 probe). This test verifies:

  1. Metaroom: the patch eliminates ``batch_loop`` (fast path);
  2. Outputs at batch=1 are bit-exact identical to the unpatched model;
  3. Outputs at batch>1 match the per-sample loop oracle to float32
     precision (rel diff <= 1e-5; the only source of disagreement is
     conv accumulation order, which is float32-noise level).

Skipped if the metaroom ONNX file is not on disk.

INFRASTRUCTURE DEPENDENCY (read before running in CI):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This test requires the VNN-COMP 2025 benchmark repo to be present at::

    ~/v/other/VNNCOMP/vnncomp2025_benchmarks/

specifically the metaroom_2023 ONNX file referenced by ``_METAROOM_GZ``
below. The ``metaroom_onnx_path`` fixture (see below) calls
``pytest.skip()`` when this file is absent, so on machines without the
VNN-COMP repo every test in this module silently skips. This is
intentional -- we don't want the test suite to crash on developer boxes
that don't have the (large) external benchmark data -- but it also
means CI gets no signal from this file unless the repo is mounted.

This is currently the ONLY test in the repository that depends on real
VNN-COMP benchmark data. Every other VNN-COMP-flavored test (e.g.
``tests/integration/test_vnncomp_runner.py``) builds synthetic ONNX
inside ``tmp_path`` and is fully self-contained.

To exercise this test in CI, the VNN-COMP 2025 benchmark repo would
need to be mounted (or at least the single ``metaroom_2023`` ONNX
checked into a fixtures directory) so that ``_METAROOM_GZ`` resolves.
