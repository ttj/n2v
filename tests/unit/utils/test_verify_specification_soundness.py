"""Soundness invariants for verify_specification's sound (Star/Box) dispatch.

Locks the −150-critical rule for the UNSAT (holds) lane: a sound reach set may
be declared UNSAT ONLY when it is genuinely DISJOINT from the unsafe region. An
over-approximate reach set that still intersects the unsafe region MUST return
UNKNOWN, never a false UNSAT (a false UNSAT is an unsound 'holds' → −150).

These are the regression guard for the whole Track-B reach-tuning effort: any
change to the reach/relaxation paths that lets an intersecting set be reported
UNSAT must fail here.
