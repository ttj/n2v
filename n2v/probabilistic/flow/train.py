"""
OT-CFM training loop for flow matching.

Trains a velocity field to transport data toward a standard Gaussian.
Pairs (x0 ~ N(0,I), x1 = data), interpolates x_t = (1-t)*x0 + t*x1,
and regresses v_theta(t, x_t) against the target velocity x1 - x0.

Supports two OT coupling methods:
  - Hungarian (exact, O(n^3), CPU-only via scipy)
  - Sinkhorn (approximate, GPU-friendly, pure tensor ops)

    doesn't underflow. This helper probes the actual cost by sampling a batch

    Train the velocity field using OT-CFM.

    Args:
        velocity_field: VelocityField module to train.
        training_outputs: (n, d) tensor of training data points.
        n_epochs: Number of training epochs.
        batch_size: Batch size.
        lr: Learning rate.
        coupling: OT coupling method. One of:
            'none' — random pairing (no OT)
            'hungarian' — exact OT via Hungarian algorithm (CPU-only)
            'sinkhorn' — approximate OT via Sinkhorn (GPU-friendly)
        sinkhorn_reg: Entropic regularization strength for Sinkhorn coupling.
            If ``'auto'`` (the default), it is computed adaptively from the
            training data via :func:`compute_adaptive_sinkhorn_reg`, which
            scales ``reg`` with the data's typical cost magnitude so the
            Sinkhorn kernel stays numerically stable regardless of output
            scale. Pass a numeric value to override (e.g. ``0.05`` to
            reproduce the pre-2026-04-14 hardcoded behavior). Smaller values
            are closer to exact OT but numerically less stable. Ignored for
            non-sinkhorn couplings.
        sinkhorn_iters: Number of Sinkhorn iterations when
            ``coupling='sinkhorn'``. Ignored for other coupling methods.
            Defaults to 50 (the previously hardcoded value).
        use_ema: If True, maintain an exponential moving average of the
            model parameters during training and copy the EMA weights into
            the returned model at the end. Has no effect on the in-loop
            training dynamics — only the final returned weights change.
            Defaults to False (byte-identical to pre-change behavior).
        ema_decay: EMA decay factor. Each step,
            ``ema = ema_decay * ema + (1 - ema_decay) * current``. Ignored
            when ``use_ema=False``. Defaults to 0.999.
        optimizer: Optimizer to use. One of ``'adam'`` (default) or
            ``'adamw'``. Defaults to ``'adam'`` (byte-identical to
            pre-change behavior).
        weight_decay: Weight decay coefficient passed to ``AdamW`` when
            ``optimizer='adamw'``. Ignored for ``'adam'``. Defaults to 0.0.
        lr_warmup_frac: Fraction of ``n_epochs`` used as a linear LR warmup
            prefix. When ``> 0``, the LR linearly ramps from near-0 to ``lr``
            over the first ``lr_warmup_frac * n_epochs`` epochs, then cosine
            decays from ``lr`` to 0 over the remainder, via
            ``SequentialLR(LinearLR, CosineAnnealingLR)``. When ``0.0`` (the
            default), the existing pure cosine schedule is preserved
            byte-identically.
        grad_clip: If not None, clip the gradient norm of the velocity
            field parameters to this maximum value after ``loss.backward()``
            and before ``opt.step()`` via
            ``torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_``. When ``None`` (the default),
            no clipping is applied and behavior is byte-identical to the
            pre-change path.
        time_sampling: How to sample the interpolation time ``t`` for each
            batch. One of ``'uniform'`` (default; ``t ~ U(0, 1)``) or
            ``'logit_normal'`` (``u ~ N(0, 1)``, ``t = sigmoid(u)``, which
            concentrates ``t`` around ``0.5`` with tails toward ``0`` and
            ``1``). The default preserves byte-identical behavior with the
            pre-change path.
        coupling_batch_size: If not None, the DataLoader is configured with
            this batch size and each large coupled batch is sliced into
            ``batch_size``-sized minibatches for gradient steps. OT coupling
            is computed once per large batch (not per optimizer step), which
            yields higher-quality coupling for the same number of optimizer
            updates. Must be a multiple of ``batch_size``. When ``None`` (the
            default), coupling runs on each optimizer batch and behavior is
            byte-identical to the pre-change path.
        standardize_outputs: If True, compute per-dimension mean/std of
            ``training_outputs`` once, whiten the training data in-place to
            unit variance, train on the whitened data, and then register
            ``y_mean`` / ``y_std`` as buffers on ``velocity_field`` so that
            ``forward(t, y)`` whitens incoming ``y`` and de-whitens its
            output velocity. This keeps inference-time callers in the
            original output space. The buffers are deliberately set
            **after** training (not before), otherwise the forward pass
            during training would double-whiten the already-whitened data.
            When ``False`` (the default), no buffers are registered and
            behavior is byte-identical to the pre-change path.
        refresh_data_each_epoch: Optional zero-arg callable returning a
            fresh ``(n, d)`` training tensor. When provided, the callable is
            invoked at the start of every epoch (including epoch 0) and the
            DataLoader is rebuilt from the returned tensor, enabling
            "fresh pushforward samples per epoch" workflows. The initial
            ``training_outputs`` passed to this function is ignored for
            training in that case (but is still used to compute the
            whitening statistics when ``standardize_outputs=True``). Fresh
            data is whitened using the *initial* statistics — they are not
            recomputed per epoch. When ``None`` (the default), the
            DataLoader is built once before the loop and behavior is
            byte-identical to the pre-change path.
        fixed_noise: Optional ``(n, d)`` tensor of pre-coupled Gaussian
            source samples paired row-wise with ``training_outputs``. When
            provided, the training loop uses ``fixed_noise[i]`` as the
            ``x_0`` paired with ``training_outputs[i]`` (rather than
            sampling fresh ``randn_like`` noise each batch). This is the
            entry point for ReFlow: the caller integrates the ODE to obtain
            matched ``(x_0, x_1)`` pairs and passes them in so training
            respects the coupling. Requires ``coupling='none'`` (since any
            other coupling would re-permute the pairs and discard the
            provided coupling) and ``fixed_noise.shape ==
            training_outputs.shape``. When ``None`` (the default), the
            pre-change behavior is preserved byte-identically.
        compile: If True, wrap ``velocity_field`` with
            ``torch.compile(..., mode='reduce-overhead')`` for the hot
            forward pass in the training loop. The compiled callable is
            used for ``pred_v`` inside the inner loop only; EMA updates and
            the final EMA copy-back still operate on the original module's
            parameters (which are shared with the compiled wrapper). Pays
            a ~15-30s one-time compile cost — worth it for runs ≥ 2000
            epochs, usually a wash for shorter ones. Defaults to False so
            behavior is unchanged unless explicitly requested.
