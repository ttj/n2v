### Performance Optimizations

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Direct HiGHS API (highspy) | Batch LP solving via `solve_lp_batch()`; builds HiGHS model once for all objectives. Install: `pip install n2v[highs]` |
| scipy linprog (HiGHS) | Default solver; fast C++ backend via scipy. Fallback when highspy not installed |
| Dimension-level batching | `get_ranges()` and `get_box()` batch all min/max LPs into a single `solve_lp_batch()` call |

| BatchNorm fusion | Fuse BatchNorm into preceding Linear/Conv for fewer layers |
| 4D ImageStar ops | Conv2D and pooling applied directly to 4D tensors without flattening |

### ONNX Support

Models loaded via `load_onnx()` are converted to PyTorch `GraphModule` via onnx2torch. The graph execution engine handles these ONNX-specific operations:

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| OnnxReshape | Format conversion (NCHW to HWC and back) |
| OnnxConcat | Concatenation along specified axis |
| OnnxSlice / OnnxSliceV9 | Rectangular slicing with axis mapping |
| OnnxSplit / OnnxSplit13 | Splitting along axis |
| OnnxBinaryMathOperation | Add, Sub, Mul, Div (one computed operand, one constant) |
| OnnxMatMul | Matrix multiplication with constant weights |
| OnnxReduceSum / OnnxReduceMean | Reduction along specified axes |
| OnnxResize | Nearest-neighbor upsampling (scale detection via forward probing) |
| OnnxTranspose | Coordinate permutation |
| OnnxNeg | Negation |
| OnnxCast | Type casting (no-op) |
| OnnxPad | Zero-padding |

Element-wise multiplication between two computed (non-constant) Star operands uses McCormick relaxation (4 envelope constraints per dimension).

### VNN-COMP Infrastructure

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `run_instance.py` | 3-stage verifier: falsify, approx, exact |
| `prepare_instance.py` | ONNX model loading + VNNLIB parsing + input set creation |
| `benchmark_configs.py` | Per-benchmark strategies for 28 benchmarks |
| `smoke_test.sh` | 1 instance per benchmark, quick compatibility check |
| `run_benchmark.sh` | All instances from a single benchmark directory |
| VNN-COMP output format | `sat`/`unsat`/`unknown`/`timeout` + counterexample formatting |

### Testing

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Unit tests | ~1060 | Sets, layer ops, dispatcher, VNNLIB parsing, probabilistic, integration |
| Soundness tests | ~190 | Mathematical correctness: exact contains approx, bounds valid, ground truth |
| Skipped tests | 2 | Conv2d Zonotope (not implemented), sklearn PCA (optional dep) |

Soundness test coverage exists for: Linear, ReLU, LeakyReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Conv2D, Conv1D, MaxPool2D, AvgPool2D, Flatten, Sign, Upsample, BatchNorm, Probabilistic.

## Known Limitations

1. **Falsification assumes hyperbox inputs** — Random sampling and PGD projection operate on axis-aligned bounds `[lb, ub]`. For polytope input sets (Star with non-trivial constraints), counterexamples outside the true input region may be tested, or valid counterexamples may be missed.

2. **Upsample only supports nearest-neighbor** — Bilinear and bicubic interpolation are not implemented. Only integer scale factors work.

3. **OnnxResize requires forward probing** — Scale factors are detected by running a dummy forward pass because not all ONNX attributes are stored.

4. **Hexatope/Octatope MCF solver** — Some edge cases in `get_range()` and `optimize_linear()` with minimum cost flow may return None. Tests for these cases are skipped.

5. **Conv2D requires image-aware sets** — Cannot apply Conv2D to a flat Star or Box; must use ImageStar or ImageZono with known spatial dimensions.

6. **Sigmoid/Tanh have no exact Star method** — Only approximation is available. A warning is emitted if `method='exact'` is requested.

7. **Approx ReLU neuron classification strategy** — The approximate Star ReLU currently uses `estimate_ranges()` (predicate bounds, no LP solves) to classify neurons as active/inactive/unstable. This is fast but may over-count unstable neurons, adding unnecessary triangle relaxation constraints. An alternative is using `get_range()` (LP per neuron) for tighter classification, which MATLAB NNV uses in `reach_star_approx2`. Investigating the speed-tightness trade-off between these approaches is future work, especially for deep networks where over-approximation error compounds across layers.

## To-Do

### Missing Layers

#### High Priority
- [ ] **Softmax** (`nn.Softmax`) — Common output layer for classification. Nonlinear; needs over-approximation strategy.
- [ ] **LayerNorm** (`nn.LayerNorm`) — Used in transformers. Involves mean/variance computation over features.
- [ ] **GELU** (`nn.GELU`) — Common in transformers. Smooth nonlinearity; needs S-curve-style relaxation.

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Conv3D** (`nn.Conv3d`) — 3D convolutions for volumetric data.
- [ ] **TransposedConv2D** (`nn.ConvTranspose2d`) — Deconvolutions for generative models.
- [ ] **GlobalMaxPool** (`nn.AdaptiveMaxPool2d`) — Like MaxPool but over entire spatial dimensions.
- [ ] **MaxUnpool2D** (`nn.MaxUnpool2d`) — Inverse of MaxPool.
- [ ] **GroupConv** — Grouped convolutions (used in ResNeXt, MobileNet).

#### Low Priority
- [ ] **LSTM / GRU / RNN** — Recurrent layers. Would require unrolling or custom handling.
- [ ] **HardSigmoid / HardSwish** — Piecewise linear approximations to sigmoid/swish.
- [ ] **Attention / MultiHeadAttention** — Transformer core. Complex; involves softmax + matmul.

### Missing Set Type Coverage

These are operations that work for Star/ImageStar but not yet for other set types. Listed in rough priority order:

- [ ] Conv2D on Box (build convolution matrix, apply as affine map)
- [ ] MaxPool2D on Box (interval max over pooling windows)
- [ ] AvgPool2D on Box (interval mean — placeholder exists but doesn't process)
- [ ] Concat on Zono (generator concatenation along axis)
- [ ] Slice on Zono (generator slicing)
- [ ] Split on Zono (generator splitting)
- [ ] Residual Add on Zono (Minkowski sum of two Zonos from shared input)
- [ ] LeakyReLU on Hexatope/Octatope
- [ ] Sigmoid/Tanh on Hexatope/Octatope

### Falsification Improvements

- [ ] **Polytope input sampling** — Support non-hyperbox input sets via hit-and-run sampling or LP-based projection for the falsification module.
- [ ] **Gradient-free methods** — CMA-ES or other derivative-free optimizers as alternatives to PGD for networks with zero-gradient activations (e.g., Sign).

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **GitHub Actions CI/CD** — Automated test runs on push/PR.
- [ ] **Gurobi LP solver backend** — 10-100x faster than open-source solvers. Free for academics.
- [ ] **LP strategy benchmarking** — Benchmark parallel-only vs batch-only vs parallel+batch on high-core-count machines to determine optimal default strategy for `get_ranges()`.
- [ ] **Approx ReLU neuron classification** — Evaluate using `estimate_ranges()` instead of LP-based `get_range()` for neuron classification in approximate Star ReLU. Compare speed and tightness trade-off against current hybrid approach. See Known Limitations #7.

### Documentation

- [ ] **CLAUDE.md layer table** — Update to match current state (some entries still show "In progress" for completed layers).
- [ ] **Benchmark suite** — Build a regression benchmark that measures correctness + tightness + speed (see `benchmarks/README.md`).
