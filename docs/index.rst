n2v: Neural Network Verification Toolbox
========================================

.. rst-class:: lead

   **n2v** is a Python toolbox for neural network verification using sound set-based
   reachability analysis and probabilistic verification via conformal inference.
   It supports PyTorch models and ONNX networks.

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   import torch.nn as nn
   import numpy as np
   import n2v
   from n2v.sets import Star

   # Define a PyTorch model
   model = nn.Sequential(
       nn.Linear(3, 10),
       nn.ReLU(),
       nn.Linear(10, 2)
   )
   model.eval()

   # Create input set (L-inf ball)
   center = np.array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5])
   epsilon = 0.1
   input_star = Star.from_bounds(center - epsilon, center + epsilon)

   # Compute reachable output set
   net = n2v.NeuralNetwork(model)
   output_stars = net.reach(input_star, method='exact')

   # Extract bounds
   for star in output_stars:
       lb, ub = star.get_ranges()
       print(f"Output bounds: [{lb.flatten()}, {ub.flatten()}]")
